        "Reinsurance is a vital mechanism in the insurance industry, allowing insurance companies to manage risk by transferring portions of their liabilities to other insurers/reinsurers. This process helps stabilize insurance markets, ensures solvency, and enables insurers to underwrite policies they might otherwise deem too risky.\n",
        "\n",
        "Facultative reinsurance involves individual, case-by-case agreements between the ceding insurer and the reinsurer. Each policy or risk is separately negotiated and underwritten, allowing for tailored coverage.\n",
        "**Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII)**, also known as **Professional Liability Insurance (PLI)** or **Errors and Omissions insurance (E&O)**, is a type of insurance coverage designed to protect professionals and businesses against claims made by clients or third parties for financial losses resulting from negligent acts, errors, or omissions in the performance of professional services. This insurance typically covers legal Defense costs, and any damages awarded, up to the policy limits.\n",

Impairment of trade receivables is recognised in the income statement under administrative expenses when there is objective evidence that the partnership will not be able to collect all amounts due per the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The impairment provision is based on the difference between the carrying amount and the present fair value of the expected cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. Receivables not collectible are written off against the impairment provision. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement under administrative expenses in the year of their recovery.\"\n",

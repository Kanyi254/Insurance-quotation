# Business Understanding for Medical Quota Share Treaty Project
1. Business Objective: The main goal of this project is to analyze and optimize medical quota share treaties, which involve sharing risks and premiums between insurers and reinsurers. The key objectives include:

Risk Management: Identifying trends in claims and premiums to better manage risk sharing between insurers and reinsurers.

Anomaly Detection: Detecting unusual or unexpected claims or premium events that may indicate fraud, operational inefficiencies, or significant deviations from expected patterns.

Optimization: Recommending adjustments to treaties to improve profitability and reduce risk exposure.

Predictive Insights: Forecasting future claims and premiums based on historical data to assist in treaty planning and management.

2. Key Business Questions:

Anomaly Detection: Are there any unusual claims or premium transactions that deviate from expected patterns? This could help detect fraud, underwriting errors, or outliers.

Claims and Risk Querying: What is the current claims experience under a specific treaty, and how does it affect risk exposure?

Predictive Insights: What are the expected claims and premiums for future periods, and how might they impact the treaty's profitability?

Treaty Optimization: How should the quota share arrangement be adjusted to balance profitability and risk exposure for both the insurer and reinsurer?

Data Summaries: What is the overall performance of the treaty, including total premiums, claims paid, and outstanding balances?

3. Stakeholders:

Insurers: Interested in managing their risk exposure, improving profitability, and ensuring that the reinsurer covers a fair share of risks.

Reinsurers: Want to ensure they are not taking on excessive risk while still maintaining a profitable relationship with insurers.

Actuaries and Analysts: Need tools to analyze and predict claims, premiums, and other key financial metrics.

Underwriting Teams: Require insights into how to adjust treaty terms and conditions to optimize risk-sharing agreements.

4. Success Criteria:

Operational Efficiency: Automating the analysis of quota share treaties with predictive models and anomaly detection tools.

Improved Decision-Making: Providing actionable insights to stakeholders through risk assessments, forecasts, and treaty optimization recommendations.

Minimized Risk: Detecting and alerting stakeholders to anomalous claims or premium transactions to mitigate risks like fraud or data inconsistencies.

Profitability: Helping insurers and reinsurers optimize their treaty agreements to maximize profitability while balancing risk.
